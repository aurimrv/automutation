# AutoMutation

A prototype tool is under development in the context of the project "High-Efficiency, Low-Technical Debt Mutation-Based Software Testing: Automated Process and Free Support Environment Prototype," supported by FAPESP Process nยบ 2019/23160-0.

The first step is to create docker components that wrap up traditional mutation testing tools for Java, Python, and C. This makes it possible to call these tools via API calls in a DevOps pipeline.
